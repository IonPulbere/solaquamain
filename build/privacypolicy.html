        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Alternative Energy Ireland is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
           the security of your information. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure,
            to maintain the accuracy of all data and to ensure the appropriate restrictions
            on use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and
             managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
              You can visit www.aei.ie to read about the company, products and services. You
              can also read about employment opportunities. We've structured the Web site so
              that, in general, you can visit it without identifying yourself or revealing personal
              information. In some circumstances, Alternative Energy Ireland may request personal
               information from you, such your name, e-mail address and company name or telephone
               number. Examples include on line registration or trial of Alternative Energy Ireland
               products, services, and training courses, participating in a beta program or joining
               a user group. Your response to these inquiries is strictly voluntary, although it may
                be necessary to complete the activity with which the information is associated.
                Alternative Energy Ireland may use this information to customize your experience on
                 our Web site. In addition, Alternative Energy Ireland may use this information for other
                  business purposes, such as alerting you to products and services that can assist you in
                  your business or assisting in order processing. Once you choose to provide us personally
                   identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be
                    assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with Alternative Energy
                     Ireland. If you do provide personal information, we will not disclose (share, sell or divulge)
                      it to external organisations unless we have informed you or are required to do so by law.</p>
          <p>
            In general, AEI does not collect, store, use or disclose personally identifying information except
            in very specific instances, such as, for example, when you use our “ instant price form”,  email us
             or have had multiple previous communications with an AEI representative. Whenever we collect such information,
             You may request access to, rectification, erasure or restriction of your Data, or object to the processing of
              your Data or Data portability at any time. The retention period for your data depends on the relationship with
               us, we need to retain customer and client data indefinitely, for non customer / client data we retain this
                information for a period of 60 months. We will respond to your request in writing as soon as practicable
                and in any event within one month of receipt of your request. We may request proof of identification to
                verify your request. All requests should be addressed to <a href="mailto:solaqua2018@gmail.com">solaqua2018@gmail.com</a>
          </p>
          <p>You may also use the above contact information if you think any information about you is inaccurate, incomplete,
             or if you want to change the sort of information about you that AEI may have collected.
           </p>
           <p>
             You have the right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commissioner if you are unhappy with how we are processing your Data.
           </p>
           <h1>Information we may collect from you</h1>
           <p>
             We capture general information concerning your use of Alternative Energy Ireland products and services.
             This may include general information, such as installation and un-installation of the Alternative Energy Ireland client,
              the time and frequency of your usage, changes in preference, which functions you accessed and the topology of your
              information sharing with other Alternative Energy Ireland users. Debtor communications passed through the Alternative
               Energy Ireland servers are restricted to your domain and no third party has access to this information nor will it be
                shared with any third party.
           </p>
           <p>
             We only collect Data about you on the site which you volunteer when you email us or
             if you report a problem with our Site. When you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
              We also collect Data automatically when you navigate through our Site, as explained in our
              <a href="cookiepolicy.html#privacy-policy" id="c-p">Cookie Policy</a>.

           </p>
           <p>We may collect and process the following data about you: your IP address, your browser type, and your referring URL</p>
           <h1>LAWFULNESS OF PROCESSING</h1>
           <p>There are six alternative ways in which the lawfulness of a specific case of processing of personal data
             may be established under the GDPR.
           </p>
           <p>It is AEI’s policy to identify the appropriate basis for processing and to document it, in accordance with the regulation. The options are described in brief in the following sections.
           </p>
           <ol>
             <li>
               <h2>Consent</h2>
               <p>Unless it is necessary for a reason allowable in the GDPR, AEI will always obtain explicit consent from a data subject to collect and process their data. Transparent information about our usage of their personal data will be provided to data subjects at the time that consent is obtained and their rights with regard to their data explained, such as the right to withdraw consent.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <h2>Performance of a Contract</h2>
               <p>Where the personal data collected and processed are required to fulfil a contract with the data subject's, explicit consent is not required. This will often be the case where the contract cannot be completed without the personal data in question e.g. a delivery cannot be made without an address to deliver to.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <h2>Legal Obligation</h2>
               <p>If the personal data is required to be collected and processed in order to comply with the law, then explicit consent is not required. This may be the case for some data related to employment and taxation for example, and for many areas addressed by the public sector.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <h2>Vital Interests of the Data Subject</h2>
               <p>In a case where the personal data are required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, then this may be used as the lawful basis of the processing. AEI will retain reasonable, documented evidence that this is the case, whenever this reason is used as the lawful basis of the processing of personal data.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <h2>Task Carried Out in the Public Interest</h2>
               <p>Where AEI needs to perform a task that it believes is in the public interest or as part of an official duty then the data subject’s consent will not be requested. The assessment of the public interest or official duty will be documented and made available as evidence where required.</p>
             </li>
             <li>
               <h2>Legitimate Interests</h2>
               <p>If the processing of specific personal data is in the legitimate interests of AEI and is judged not to affect the rights and freedoms of the data subject in a significant way, then this may be defined as the lawful reason for the processing. Again, the reasoning behind this view will be documented.</p>
             </li>

           </ol>
